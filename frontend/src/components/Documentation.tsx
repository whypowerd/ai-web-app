              With the technologies we have available and understanding the current state of advancements and economic trends it is clear that outdated physical labor grueling 9 to 5s and mundane careers are longer what we look for or need.

              We are creating the tools that empower everyone to pursue their true version of success and fulfillment. We are providing a space for people to come together and walk in the footprints of their true selves.

              We are harnessing the power of social media to build a community through inspiring art, thought provoking quotes and other forms of engaging content. Beyond this, we are creating value in the form of modern tools and technologies, we provide a place for people to discuss, connect and collaborate, we are going to be hosting events IRL, and have other social aspects planned out for the future.

              We are leveraging the power of the blockchain in various ways. One key aspect is the incorporation of a coin that will be deeply integrated into our project. The goal is to not only on-board more onto the Solana blockchain but to also onboard many onto the culture of $why with our coin.
